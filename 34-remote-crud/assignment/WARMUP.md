====================================================================

## Assignment

### Practice Traversing Binary Trees

**For this practice, use your binary tree module from your `data-structures-and-algorithms` repository.**

* Require your binary tree or binary search tree class
* Create a tree by inserting 10+ nodes
* Write out the `preOrder()`, `inOrder()`, and `postOrder()` methods
  * Note the order in which they travel the tree (draw it)
  * Note the output order of the node values

Do this first with reference code, then from memory. Commit to seeing which order these travel the tree and in what order the values come out in both a BT and a BST

It is recommended that you do this a few times so that you build up more "muscle memory" in the Binary Tree traversal process.
