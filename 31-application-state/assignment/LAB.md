=============================================================


## Before you begin
* You'll need to initialize this lab folder as a new node module, install your dependencies, setup your npm script commands, and pull in your config files

## Assignments

### Connect to a store
For this assignment, you're going to take an existing component which puts out some random numbers when a div is clicked, and refactor it to use a Redux store instead of local state.

* Fork this sandbox: [starter code: app-state - connect](https://codesandbox.io/s/ojl539kkz5)
* Connect `index.js` to the redux store and pass it down to the `App` component
* Remove the state declaration in the constructor
  * Do you still need a constructor?
* Bring in the actions to `app.js`
* Map state and dispatch to props in `app.js`
  * use `stuff` as your state keyword.
* Export the connected `App` component
* Render `this.props.stuff.foo` instead of `this.state.foo`
* Remove the `handleChange()` method in `app.js`
* Re-Implement the click event on the `<div>` using the action method that you mapped earlier

### Create a new reducer
In this assignment, we have a working app that uses Redux for it's state management. Now, it's time to extend it and add a new component with it's own reducer/actions. The twist is that this new reducer will also be able to respond to actions that the other component fires.

* Fork this sandbox: [starter code: app-state - reducers](https://codesandbox.io/s/zlk5o2y6wp)
* Create a new numbers reducer in the store: `numbers-reducer.js`
* Create a new numbers action in the store: `numbers-actions.js`
* Create a new action creator for the "RESET" action
* Connect to the reducer in the store's `index.js` file and export it's state as "numbers"
* The initial state should be a simple object with one key: currentNumber, set to any number you would like
* In the reducer, create a listener (in the `case`) for both the `CHANGE` and `RESET` actions
* On `CHANGE`, change the number to a random number
* On `RESET`, reset the state back to the `initialState`
* Create a new `Numbers` component that renders a `<div>` with the content "Hello"
* Import this into your `<App>` and render it below the content already being rendered
  * You should see your app's output along with "Hello" at this point
* Import your numbers actions
* Connect the Numbers component to the store and map the numbers actions and state to Props.
* Render `this.props.numbers.currentNumber`


###### Testing
* Write unit tests for your reducers (assert on the state of their state given different actions being run)
* Write integration (mount) tests on your components to assert wiring is solid and events are properly affecting state.


###### Stretch Goals:
* Do all of this again, but from scratch
* Add a third reducer and subscribe to both bits of state
