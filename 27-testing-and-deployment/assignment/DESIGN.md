![CF](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) DESIGN - SASS Setup
=========================================================

## Assignment
For this warm-up, we'll be creating a new repo where we'll be storing our design as we build it throughout the course.

During your build-outs of React components, you'll be pulling from and adding to this repo, moving things around, and generally setting up your personal design workflow.

### Requirements
* Work in a fork of your "sass-design" repository in your github account
* Modularize your design by creating the following file structure
  * design.scss
    * At the top, do an `@import` for each of the following partials ...
    * _reset.scss (paste in the meyer reset)
    * _variables.scss (set a few key variables for your design)
      * `$rootColor`
      * `$accentColor`
      * `$bleed`
      * `$space`
    * _mixins.scss
      * Create a mixin to provide a border radius (given a parameter)
      * Create a mixin to specify the right bleed between cards and decks
    * _core.scss
      * Core styles for your design (i.e. body tag, etc)
