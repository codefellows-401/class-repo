================================================================

## Assignment
For this warm-up, let's install create-react-app and get a hello world going

### Tasks
* Globally install Create React App -- `npm i -g create-react-app`
* Create a new, empty repository called `react-starter` with a README and clone it to a folder on your computer
* Navigate into that folder in the terminal
* Create a new react app, called `reactapp`
  * `create-react-app . reactapp`
  * This instructs create-react-app to make a new app for you in the `.` or current folder
  * If you wanted to fresh, outside of a previously created folder, you could omit that
* Start up the dev server
  * `npm start`
* Confirm that you can see the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`
* Open vscode and edit the App.js file
* Create `<Header />` and `<Main />`, and `<Footer />` components in separate files
* Edit each with some basic "hello world" style content
* Initialize `Main` with a bit of state and have that `render()`
* Copy in your design folder from your design repo (copy and paste is fine)
* Import the `design/design.scss` file in the `App.js` file
* Import those 3 components and have the `<App />` component render them out
* Confirm that you have a working, somewhat styled app.

### Submission Instructions
Report in canvas with a screen-shot of your running app, and how long it took you to complete this assignment.
